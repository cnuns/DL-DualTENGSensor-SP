Deep Learning-based Dual-reference Triboelectric Sensor for Direct Surface Potential Prediction

This repository shows how to load the data and train the model associated with the paper “Deep Learning-based Dual-reference Triboelectric Sensor for Direct Surface Potential Prediction”. 
This code was initially performed in MATLAB, but it is also possible to access information in Python. In the MATLAB files (.mat), this data is stored in a cell according to the periodic and repetitive experiments. The raw data is also available in Excel format (.csv).
